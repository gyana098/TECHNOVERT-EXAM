Q5. What are Higher-Order Components (HOC) in React and how do they work?
ANS:-
Higher-Order Components (HOC) are an advanced and powerful pattern in React that allows for component composition and code reuse. An HOC is a function that takes a component as input and returns a new component with additional props or behavior. It doesn't modify the original component but enhances it with extra functionality.

EXAMPLE:-

function higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent) {
  return class EnhancedComponent extends React.Component {
    // Additional logic and behavior can be added here
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
}
